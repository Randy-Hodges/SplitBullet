SplitBullet is a game loosely based off of Stardew Valley's [Journey of the Prairie King](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Journey_of_the_Prairie_King). In this game (created entirely in the Processing language), the player controls a pistol-wielding character whose main objective is to survive as many waves of enemies as possible. During their survival quest, they will encounter fast enemies, slow enemies, powerups, and a variety of bosses. 

## How to Play
### Build
First, you must download the Processing language and the code in this repository. This can be achieved by downloading Processing from ([https://processing.org/download](https://processing.org/download)) and then cloning this repository ([https://github.com/Randy-Hodges/SplitBullet](https://github.com/Randy-Hodges/SplitBullet)). After downloading the code, ensure that you have the minim library installed by entering the Processing app and then going to (in the top bar) Sketch->Import Library->Add Library and then searching for "minim". Once the code is downloaded, you can press the run button (circular play icon) from the Processing editor and the game will launch.

### Download
Visit the "[Releases](https://github.com/Randy-Hodges/SplitBullet/releases)" tab and download the asset that matches your platform.

### Play
Once in the game, you can use the mouse to select options from the main menu. When you press the 'play' button, the waves of enemies will begin. You can use the AWSD keys to move and the mouse to aim and shoot. Additionally you can press the 'p' key to pause the game, 'm' while paused to mute the game, and 'esc' to quit the entire program.
